Some concepts are borrowed from Python, others from\r\nJava, but most are original. Be sure to check out the [wiki](https://github.com/arshajii/Xi/wiki) to learn more.\r\n\r\nInstalling and Running\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to do this is to make use of the Xi Java Archive (see [`jar`](https://github.com/arshajii/xi/tree/master/jar) folder and the [`README`](https://github.com/arshajii/xi/tree/master/jar#xi-java-archive) therein). \r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\nRefer to the [examples](https://github.com/arshajii/Xi/tree/master/examples) folder for a full list of examples and descriptions.\r\n\r\n### hello.xi  \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nprintln \"hello world\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot much to say here - just a simple \"hello world\" program.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### euler1.xi\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nprintln $ / {| ! % . 3 ! % . 5} , 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a solution to [Problem #1](http://projecteuler.net/problem=1) of [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net). The problem reads as follows:\r\n\r\n>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.\r\nFind the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.\r\n\r\nFirst, we create a list of integers from `0` to `999` with `, 1000`. Next, we filter this list (using `/`) with the block `{| ! % . 3 ! % . 5}`; in other words,\r\nwe remove any element `.` for which `{| ! % . 3 ! % . 5}` is *not* true. Further, this block only returns true if `.` is either divisible by `3` (i.e.\r\n`! % . 3`) or if it is divisible by `5` (i.e. `! % . 5`). This results in a list of all multiples of either `3` or `5` less than `1000`. Lastly, we\r\nfind the sum of this list using `$`, resulting in the desired answer.\r\n\r\nEquivalent code in Java would be:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Euler1 {\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\tint sum = 0;\r\n\t\tfor (int i = 1 ; i < 1000 ; i++)\r\n\t\t\tif (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0)\r\n\t\t\t\tsum += i;\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(sum);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n### euler16.xi\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nprintln $ @ {int .} list str ** 2L 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a solution to [Problem #16](http://projecteuler.net/problem=16) of [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net). The problem reads as follows:\r\n\r\n>2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.\r\n\r\n>What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?\r\n\r\nThis program works by first actually evaluating 2^1000: `** 2L 1000`. Notice here that `2L` is a *long* literal so we have the capacity to store a number this large. \r\n\r\nOnce we have this number, we perform two operations, namely `str` followed by `list`. `str` turns the number into a string, and `list` turns this string into a list of its constituent character. For example, `list str \"1234\"` would result in `[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\"]`.\r\n\r\nAfter forming this list, we perform an `@` mapping on it using the block `{int .}`. In other words, we convert each 'int string' element of the list to an actual integer. For the previous example, we would obtain `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Ultimately, we have taken a number and used it to create a list of nonnegative integers less than 10 representing its digits.\r\n\r\nThe final operation is `$`, which simply adds up the elements of this list to obtain the desired result.\r\n\r\nA short solution to this problem in Java would be\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Euler16 {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        char[] digits = BigInteger.valueOf(2L).pow(1000).toString().toCharArray();\r\n        int sum = 0;\r\n\t\t\r\n        for (char c : digits)\r\n            sum += c - '0';\r\n\t\t\r\n        System.out.println(sum);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### factorial2.xi\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nfactorial := func ('n') {\r\n\tif < n 2 {\r\n\t\treturn 1\r\n\t} {\r\n\t\treturn * n factorial - n 1\r\n\t} \t\r\n}\r\n\r\nfor 'i' , 10 {\r\n\tprintln factorial i\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example exhibits the classic recursive factorial function, which works based on the fact that `0! = 1` and `n! = n * (n-1)!` for all `n` greater than `0`.\r\n\r\nThe `if`-statement within the `factorial` function checks if `n` is less than `2` (we could have also checked that `n` is less than `1` but since `0! = 1! = 1` we might as well include both `0` and `1` in the condition). If this condition is true, we know that `n` is either `0` or `1` and hence we return `1`. Otherwise, we return `n` multuplied by `factorial - n 1`, for the reason outlined above.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent `for`-loop simply prints the factorials of every integer from `0` through `9` to ensure that everything is in order.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### fibonacci.xi\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nn := 5\r\nprintln + \"First \" + n \" Fibonacci numbers:\"\r\n\r\na := 0\r\nb := 1\r\ndo n {\r\n    c := a\r\n\ta := + a b\r\n\tb := c\r\n\tprintln b\r\n}\r\n```\r\n    \r\nThis code prints the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence. We first define `a` and `b` to be the first and second terms of the sequence, respectively.\r\nThen we have a `do`-loop which performs `n` iterations, shifting `a` and `b` one step up the sequence and printing the appropriate term on each iteration.\r\nTo \"shift up the sequence\" we simply assign the old value of `a` to `b` and assign the `a + b` to `a`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### quine.xi\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nreader := => file \"examples/quine.xi\" 'lnreader'\r\n\r\ns := ~ reader\r\nwhile {!= s null} {\r\n\tprintln s\r\n\ts := ~ reader\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn computer programming, a *quine* is a program that outputs a copy of its own source code. The above code accomplishes this by first creating a file object representing its own source file (i.e. `file \"examples/quine.xi\"`) and then obtaining the `'lnreader'` attribute of this file (using the `=>` operator). All files have an `'lnreader'` attribute that holds a lambda function capable of reading the file line by line. This lambda is stored in a variable called `reader` and subsequently used to print the contents of the source file.\r\n\r\nNote that the `~` operator can be used to evaluate lambda functions that take no arguments.\r\n\r\nTo Do\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### Language-Related\r\n- `[✓]` Implement lists subtypes thereof.\r\n- `[✓]` Allow for the creation of variables.\r\n- `[✓]` Overload various operations for various other data types, e.g. `+` for lists.\r\n- `[✓]` Implement sets and set operations.\r\n- `[✓]` Allow for the easy creation of custom functions from within Xi.\r\n- `[ ]` Make a smarter parser so as to give the user more flexibility.\r\n- `[ ]` More accurate and more specific error messages, including line number and specifically why an error occured.\r\n- `[✓]` Add a *long* or *BigInteger* numerical data type.\r\n- `[ ]` Thoroughly update built-in modules.\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n- `[✓]` Include domain name in Java source package name.\r\n- `[ ]` More comprehensive and up-to-date documentation.\r\n- `[ ]` More comprehensive and up-to-date to-do list.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis content is released under the MIT License.
